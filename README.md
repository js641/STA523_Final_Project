# STA523_Final_Project
## Shiny app Interactive with Twitter 

Since our application does not run off of an Rmd file but through the server.R & ui.R files, we couldn't source the one other file, load_package.R, required for successful compilation (loads some necessary packages for the app). We ask that you please open up this file and run it first before running our full Shiny App. Thank you for your understanding.
