# Twitter Mysteries User Manual #

## Introduction (Basic Functionality)
Our final project consists of programming an R Shiny application that performs various types of analysis on data from Twitter. Users will choose between a particular topic (or in Twitter terms, hasthags #) or a specific Twitter handle. If a topic is chosen then the user can write whatever topic comes to mind which also exists on Twitter. The app will then collect a user-selected amount of random tweets associated with that hashtag in order to build a set of words to analyze or display. Conversely, if a handle is selected then the user can write out the exact handle and the app will again collect a particular amount (set by the user, or however many tweets that handle has if less than the specified number) of the most recent tweets to analyze. After the topic or handle have been selected, the app will run world cloud, word frequency association & clustering algorihms. The specifics of these will be discused separately alongside with the options available to the user.

## Errors
Due to the random nature of many tweets and how very different ones can be grouped together by an specific topic or user, it could be the case that the app encounters some errors. For example, some users may not have many tweets and thus word association could be invalid. In addition, there may be a topic that doesn't has too many unique words and this overblows the capabilities of the clustering paramaeters. Issues like this may be solved by tuning the available options such as minimum frequency count or number of clusters to be set. We urge that a error screen does not mean the app cannot still work for other configurations.
