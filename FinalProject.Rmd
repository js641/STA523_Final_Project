# Twitter Mysteries User Manual #

## Introduction (Basic Functionality)
Our final project consists of programming an R Shiny application that performs various types of analysis on data from Twitter. Users will choose between a particular topic (or in Twitter terms, hasthags #) or a specific Twitter handle. If a topic is chosen then the user can write whatever topic comes to mind which also exists on Twitter. The app will then collect a user-selected amount of random tweets associated with that hashtag in order to build a set of words to analyze or display. Conversely, if a handle is selected then the user can write out the exact handle and the app will again collect a particular amount (set by the user, or however many tweets that handle has if less than the specified number) of the most recent tweets to analyze. After the topic or handle have been selected, the app will run world cloud, word frequency association & clustering algorihms. The specifics of these will be discused separately alongside with the options available to the user.

## Example Usage (Seen in our default app settings)
A trending topic in the news, and thus Twitter, is the terrorist organization ISIS. If our app runs this as the topic of interest, collecting 100 of latest related tweets we see that our world cloud contains very relevant terms such as terrorists, Obama, US, Syria, terrorism, terror. As we increase the number of tweets we can see some other terms with looser conections such as Russia,  Trump, passports, arrested, fighting are included. If we move to the Word Frequency association and try to use Obama as our key word to associate, words that have at least 0.5 correlation include stop, failure, exposes, turning which indicate quite neatly how divided the POTUS's action are amongst the community. Then as we move to the cluster dendogram option we can see that usual clusters involve Trump, ban (referencing Trump's recent anti-muslim remarks) or Obama and US, or just other words with violent connotations such as beating or escaping. Since the tweets are random and thius topic is popular (along with a fresh stream of tweets every hour), these exact results may not show up but the analysis was repeated various times and the most general results are being discussed.

On the other hand, we can try to search a specific Twitter handle. We chose our professor Colin Rundel's account and try to see any patterns with his tweets. With a max of 100 words in the cloud, the most popular word is github and the next few that follow are also terms related to things he has taught in 523 such as wercker, testthat, shiny, rgeos, hadleywickham. A word fequency association analysis shows that most of the words listed above are also very correlated. If we were to choose student, we see that testing and code have correlation of 1 so they are always paired together. rmd and rstats are also close with a correlation of 0.66. Finally, the cluster dendogram is very interesting here since we can toggle a different number of cluster quite nicely. Again studen, testig code are together but there is also a cluster with socks, parallel, programming, rabbaths & shiny which correctly refer to the SHiny-themed homework we had this semester. Hence we see that Professor Rundel's Twiiter is a great blueprint for his teaching style & assignments.

## Errors
Due to the random nature of many tweets and how very different ones can be grouped together by an specific topic or user, it could be the case that the app encounters some errors. For example, some users may not have many tweets and thus word association could be invalid. In addition, there may be a topic that doesn't has too many unique words and this overblows the capabilities of the clustering paramaeters. Issues like this may be solved by tuning the available options such as minimum frequency count or number of clusters to be set. We urge that a error screen does not mean the app cannot still work for other configurations.
